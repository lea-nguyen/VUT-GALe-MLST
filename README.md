# Maximum Leaf Spanning Tree
This is a repo about the max leaf spanning tree problem which was my project subject for the Graph Algorithms 2025 course at the University of Technology of Brno.

The subject was to select two algorithms on the Maximum leaf spanning tree problem and to parallelize them.

## Execute the jar

Execute the jar with :  
`java -cp .\mlst.jar maximumLeafSpanningTree.Graph <integer> <|"2-app"|"3-app">`

Explanation of arguments:  
1st  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	`integer` : |V| of the graph to create  
2nd  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no-argument : compares both algorithms  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `2-app` : 2-approximation algorithm to execute  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `3-app` : 3-approximation algorithm to execute
